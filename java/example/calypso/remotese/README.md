Getting Started - Remote SE Example
---

This project aims at implementing the concept of executing a Calypso transaction between two distants terminal. 

One terminal is acting as the Master terminal, it will pilot the transaction. The other terminal acts as a Slave, it will proxy a local Reader to allow the Master terminal to communicate with any Secure Element inserted. 

In those examples, Slave nodes listen for Calypso Portable Object (PO) while the SAM resource is connected to the Master Node.

Master and Slave communicates between each other through a transport layer that must be provided. In those examples, two tranport layer have been implemented :
- HTTP Web services with long polling
- Web socket 

Example 
---
All 4 examples execute the same scenario :
- the Slave terminal connects its local reader to the Master terminal
- the local reader is configured to select a given type of SE by default
- insert a matching SE is inserted, in response a Calypso Transaction is executed by the Master
- after a given time the SE is removed.

The ticketing logic is defined in the Master terminal, the slave Terminal acts only as a proxy. All SE inserted in the slave are accessible from the Master.

4 examples of Remote SE plugin :   
- ``Demo_Webservice_MasterClient`` : execute the demo with a Webservice protocol, the Master device uses a Retrofit client 
- ``Demo_Webservice_MasterServer`` : execute the demo with a webservice protocol, the Master device uses the webservice server
- ``DemoWsKMasterServer`` : execute the demo with a websocket protocol, the master device uses the websocket server
- ``DemoWsKMasterClient`` : execute the demo with a websocket protocol, the master device uses the websocket client

Executing the Example

###Requirements

Remotese examples requires a specific JDK in order to have the polling working correctly. 

It has been successfully tested with :
- ``jdk1.8.0_40``

Some compatibilities issues have been acknowledged with the Webservice examples on newer JDK :
- ``jdk1.8.0_231`` 
- ``adoptopenjdk-11.jdk``

###Run

Use the custom gradle tasks :
- ```./gradlew runWs_MasterClient``` to execute the demo with a Webservice protocol, the Master device uses a Retrofit client  
- ```./gradlew runWS_MasterServer``` to execute the demo with a webservice protocol, the Master device uses the webservice server
- ```./gradlew runWsK_MasterClient``` to execute the demo with a websocket protocol, the master device uses the websocket server
- ```./gradlew runWsK_MasterServer``` to execute the demo with a websocket protocol, the master device uses the websocket client
