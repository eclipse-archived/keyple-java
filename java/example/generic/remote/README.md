Those projects demonstrate the multiple use cases covered by the Remote Plugin. 

# Use Case #1 : Remote Plugin Server with Web Service example
This project showcases the synchronous mode of the Remote Plugin Server with a Web Service protocol.
This plugin allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader) see the [developer guide](https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/develop-ticketing-app-remote/#remotepluginserver).

# Use Case #1 : Remote Plugin Server with Web Socket example
This project showcases the implementation of the asynchronous mode of the Remote Plugin Server with a Web Socket protocol.
This plugin allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader), see the [developer guide](https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/develop-ticketing-app-remote/#remotepluginserver).

# Use Case #7 : Pool Remote Plugin Client with Web Service example
This project showcases the synchronous mode of the Pool Remote Plugin Client with a Web Service.
This plugin allows a client application to control a pool of smart card readers available on a server (e.g. HSM readers); see the [developer guide](https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/develop-ticketing-app-remote/#poolremotepluginclient) for more details.
