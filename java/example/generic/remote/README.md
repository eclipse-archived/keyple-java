Those projects demonstrate the multiple use cases covered by the Remote Plugin. 

# Remote Plugin Server with Web Socket example
This projects showcase the implementation of the asynchronous mode of the Remote Plugin Server. This plugin allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader), see the [developer guide](https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/develop-ticketing-app-remote/#remotepluginserver).

# Remote Plugin Server with Web Service example
This projects showcase the synchronous mode of the Remote Plugin Server. This plugin allows a client application to control a smart card reader available on a server (e.g. SAM reader) see the [developer guide](https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/develop-ticketing-app-remote/#remotepluginserver).

# Pool Remote Plugin Client with Web Service example
This projects showcase the PoolRemotePluginClient`. This plugin allows a client application to control a pool of smart card readers available on a server (e.g. HSM readers); see the [developer guide](https://calypsonet.github.io/keyple-website/docs/developer-guide/develop-ticketing-app-remote/#poolremotepluginclient) for more details.
