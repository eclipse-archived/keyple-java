   * Constructor<br>
   * This object is constructed from the list of {@link CardResponse} received from the reader
   * during the selection process. It transports the selection results into the {@link ReaderEvent}
   * when the reader is observed and also during explicit selections in the case of an unobserved
   * reader.
   *
   * <p>The list of {@link CardResponse} corresponds to the list of {@link CardRequest} present in
   * the {@link DefaultSelectionsRequest}. The first {@link CardResponse} corresponds to the first
   * {@link CardRequest} and so on.
   *
   * <p>When a {@link CardRequest} has not resulted in a response, then the corresponding {@link
   * CardResponse} in the list is null.
   *
   * <p>Depending on the setting of the selection, the process either processes all selection cases
   * provided in the {@link DefaultSelectionsRequest} or stops at the first selection case that
   * results in a response. In the latter case, the {@link CardResponse} list may be shorter than
   * the {@link CardRequest} list.
