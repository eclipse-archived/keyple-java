<p>The role of the Keyple Core module is the management of communications with the secure elements (SE) using smart card readers.</p>
<p>It implements plugins in charge of abstracting readers with or without contact through a generic API (<b>seproxy</b>
    package).<br>
    Keyple Core also provides classes for selecting and transmitting commands to SEs in a generic way with optional
    built-in observation mechanisms (<b>selection</b>, <b>command</b> and <b>event</b> packages).<br>
    In addition Keyple Core also provides utility classes for data formatting or analysis (<b>util</b> package).</p>
