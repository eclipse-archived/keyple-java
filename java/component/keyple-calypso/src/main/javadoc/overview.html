<p>The Keyple Calypso module is dedicated to the management of Calypso products: cards (or smartphones) carried by
    end-users (PO) as well as security modules integrated into the equipments (SAM).
<p>The CalypsoPo class is the core of this module. An instance is created at the end of the selection process and will
    be used for transactions to centralize the result of all the commands executed by the card.
<p>
    Symmetrically, CalypsoSam contains the SAM-related elements but will have little or no visibility to the
    application.
<p>
    These classes are located in the transaction sub-package next to the classes used to carry out selections and
    transactions.
<p>
    The two main services to start with Keyple Calypso are PoSelection and PoTransaction.
<p>
    The other classes of this package allow you to build the commands and analyze their responses.
