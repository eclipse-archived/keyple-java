# Keyple Remote Plugin - Common Lib

## Overview

The **Common Lib** Java library contains the common elements used by the [Local Lib](../local/README.md) and [Remote Lib](../remote/README.md) libraries provided by the **Keyple Remote Plugin** solution.

This library **should not be import explicitly because it's imported by transitivity** by the main libraries.

## User Guide & Download Information

The full documentation, including download information is available in the [Developer Guides / Develop a Remote Ticketing Application](http://keyple.org/docs/developer-guide/develop-ticketing-app-remote/) section of the official Keyple website [keyple.org](http://keyple.org)

## Build the Code

The code is built with **Gradle** and is compliant with **Java 1.6** in order to be able to be used by a very large number of applications.
