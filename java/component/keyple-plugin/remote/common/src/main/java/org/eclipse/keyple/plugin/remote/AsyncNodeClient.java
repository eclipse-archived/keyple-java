 * <b>Async Node Client</b> API.
 *
 * <p>This kind of node should be bind on the client's side if you want to use a full duplex
 * communication protocol, such as Web Sockets for example.
 *
 * <p>Then, you should provide an implementation of the {@link AsyncEndpointClient} interface in
 * order to interact with this node.
 *
 * <p>Keyple provides its own implementations of this interface and manages their lifecycle.<br>
 * This kind of node can be bind to a all <b>client</b> Remote plugins and services :
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code LocalServiceClient}
 *   <li>{@code RemotePluginClient}
 *   <li>{@code PoolRemotePluginClient}
 * </ul>
 *
 * To create it, you should only bind an <b>async</b> node during the initialization process.<br>
 * Then, you can access it everywhere on the client's side using one of the following utility
 * methods, depending on your use case :
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code LocalServiceClientUtils.getAsyncNode()}
 *   <li>{@code RemotePluginClientUtils.getAsyncNode()}
 *   <li>{@code PoolRemotePluginClientUtils.getAsyncNode()}
 * </ul>
