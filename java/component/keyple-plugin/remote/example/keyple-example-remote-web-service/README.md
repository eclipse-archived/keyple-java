# keyple-example-remote-web-service project

This projects aims at demonstrating how straight forward is the implementation of the synchronous mode of the Remote Plugin. 

The native reader is plugged on the client device which communicates with the server through web services.

Running the example, a complete scenario is executed: 
- client and server components are initialized
- server starts up
- a Stub calypso card is inserted in the native reader (client side)
- a remote transaction is executed by the server
- server shutdowns

By default, this example uses the keyple `StubPlugin` that emulates a Native Reader and a Card. You can activate the PCSC configuration by invoking ```initPcscReader()``` instead of  ```initStubReader()``` in the `clientApp.init()` method.      

This project depends on an external module located in `../common`. If you need a standalone module, you can copy manually all classes in the `common` module inside this project. Don't forget to delete references to the `common` module in the `gradle.properties` and `build.gradle` configuration files. 

If you are interested in an example presenting synchronous mode, checkout the webservice example.


## Running the example in dev mode

This example is based on the Quarkus framework. To execute the example in dev mode, you need to install Quarkus dependencies : 
- an IDE
- JDK 1.8+ installed with JAVA_HOME configured appropriately

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

## About Quarkus

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .



## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using `./gradlew quarkusBuild`.
It produces the `keyple-example-remote-web-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `build` directory.
Be aware that it is a _Ã¼ber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied inside the jar.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/keyple-example-remote-web-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.


## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native`.

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: `./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true`.

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/keyple-example-remote-web-service-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
