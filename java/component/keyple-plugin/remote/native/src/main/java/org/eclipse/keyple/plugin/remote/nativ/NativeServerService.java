 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>To start the service, use the factory {link NativeServerServiceFactory}.
 *   <li>To access the service, there is no method because this service is only used internally by
 *       Keyple.
 *   <li>To stop the service, there is nothing special to do because the service is a standard java
 *       singleton instance.
