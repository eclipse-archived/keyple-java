# Keyple Distributed Network

## Overview

The **Keyple Distributed Network** Java library contains the common network elements used by the [Keyple Distributed Local](../local/README.md) and [Keyple Distributed Remote](../remote/README.md) libraries provided by the **Keyple Distributed** solution.

This library **should not be import explicitly because it's imported by transitivity** by the main libraries.
