# 'Eclipse Keyple' Java implementation

This is the repository for the Java implementation of the 'Eclipse Keyple' API. 

Please find all the information you need on the [official documentation](https://keyple.org/docs) and on the [API Reference guide](https://keyple.org/docs/api-reference/)

The Keyple C++ implementation is hosted on https://github.com/eclipse/keyple-cpp.

### Running Keyple examples
This repository includes Java and Android examples of Eclipse Keyple use cases : [Keyple Examples](/java/example)

### Import Keyple components in your project
Keyple components are deployed to Maven Central thus you can import them in your project as dependencies.

Gradle project: 
```
repositories {
        //to import releases
        maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases' }
        
        //to import snapshots
        maven {url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
}

dependencies {
    // Keyple Core is a mandatory library for using Keyple, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-core
    implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-core', version: '1.0.0'
    
    // Import Calypso library to support Calypso Portable Object, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-calypso
    implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-calypso', version: '1.0.0'
    
    // Import PCSC library to use a Pcsc reader, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-plugin-pcsc
    implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-plugin-pcsc', version: '1.0.0'
}
```

### Supported platforms
- Java SE 1.6 compact2
- Android 4.4 KitKat API level 19

## Contribute to Eclipse Keyple
We welcome contributions! Every contribution will be reviewed by the developpers team and scan by our CI and quality code tools before being merged to the base code.

### CI and Docker 
Eclipse CI tools to build and test the components are Open Source too. They can be found in this repository : [Eclipse Keyple Ops](https://www.github.com/eclipse/keyple-ops)
