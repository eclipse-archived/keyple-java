## Global Architecture of Keyple

![global architecture](docs/img/Keyple-components.svg "keyple SDK global architecture")

The API is currently divided in two major layers:
- The ‘Keyple Core' : a Secure Element Proxy API which allows managing SE readers in a generic way, whaterver the reader driver or environment, and for standalone or distributed solution.
- A ‘Calypso Keyple extension' : a high level Calypso Processing API allowing to operate commands with a Calypso Portable Object, and to manage a secure Calypso transaction.

Dedicated reader’s plugins have to be implemented in order to interface the SE Proxy API with the specific reader’s drivers.

API guides for the Keyple Core and Keyple Calypso are available on [keyple.org](https://keyple.org/).

For a distributed architecture, the Remote SE Plugin should be used ([Keyple Remote SE User Guide](./docs/KeypleRemoteSe_UserGuide.md)). In version 0.9 the SE Plugin is still proposed as a draft, a simpler API will be provided in the version 1.0 alpha 1 in October 2020.

### Supported platforms
- Java SE 1.6 compact2
- Android 4.4 KitKat API level 19

### keyple-java repositories structure

- Modules that are provided as artifacts
  - keyple-core: source and unit tests for the SE Proxy module (artifact : keyple-java-core)
  - keyple-calypso: source and unit tests for the Calypso library (artifact : keyple-java-calypso)
  - keyple-plugin: source and unit tests for the different plugins: smartcard.io PC/SC, Stub, Android NFC, Android OMAPI, etc.
- developer support, testing
  - example: source for Keyple implementation examples, generic or Calypso specific.

### Keyple Core - features / packages and corresponding usages

The Keyple Core is the basic component of Keyple to handle secure element reader and to operate generic processing with Secure Elements. On Keyple, secure element readers are interfaced through specific reader plugins.

The Core is divided in 3 sub-modules:
- Reader: includes the API to access and manage a SE reader.
- Plugin: provides factorized processing for the implementation of reader plugin.
- SE: the generic operation for Secure Element.

(Starting from the version 1.0 of Keyple Core, the sub-modules will be provided in different artifacts with their own versioning).

According to the developer’s objective different API must be imported:
- for the implementation of a secure element terminal application, only the high-level API of the ‘reader’ and ‘SE’ modules.
- to implement a plugin, all the ‘reader’ API and the low-level ‘plugin’ API.
- to develop a dedicated library supporting the command sets and transaction features of a specific secure element solution, the low-level ‘reader’ and ‘SE’ API.

</tbody>
</table>

A terminal application operating secure element must only import the Keyple Core packages: ‘seproxy’, ‘event’, ‘protocol’ and ‘selection’.

![generic packages](docs/img/KeyplePackages_Core.svg "Keyple generic packages")

A reader plugin could be implemented by importing the ‘plugin’, ‘message’ and ‘seproxy’ packages.

A secure element specific library could be implemented on top of the ‘message’ and ‘command’ packages.

### Keyple Calypso - features / packages and corresponding usages

The Calypso transaction API provides a high-level of abstraction to define functional commands to manage a secure session with a Calypso Portable Object, to update or authenticate its data.

The transaction API is defined on a low-level Calypso commands API which contains the builders of PO and SAM APDU commands, and the corresponding parsers of APDU responses.

        <li>APDU response parsers<br/></li></ul>
      (technical parameter settings specific to the PO &amp; SAM revisions)<br></td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Ticketing terminal applications must import only the high-level Calypso transaction package.

![Calypso packages](docs/img/KeyplePackages_Calypso.svg "Calypso packages")

The only exception is the implementation a Calypso PO/SAM test tool, the setting of low-level APDU commands with wrong settings could require the usage of the Calypso command packages.

## Getting started
Releases and snapshots are available from Maven central repositories.

### Cloning this project
Examples provided in this project relies on symbolic links to handle their common dependencies. (Please refer to this [file](/java/example/README.md) for more information).

Although symlink support should be provided out of the box for Unix users, **Windows users** should be aware that the git option `core.symlinks` needs to be enabled before [cloning](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) this repo. Several solutions can be considered:
- When installing git for Windows, an option `Enable symbolic links` can be choosen. If it has not been enabled and you want to set it via the installer, a reinstallation is needed
- If you do not want to reinstall git, this option can be enabled afterward via the command line `git config core.symlinks true`
- Also, the option can be enabled once only for this specific cloning operation with `git clone -c core.symlinks=true REPO_URL`

It is important to note that for this option to be actually working, the Windows user needs to have the **_SeCreateSymbolicLink_ permission**: a user with admin rights is typically granted with this permission.

### Import keyple components with Gradle

When using gradle, it is fairly simple to import Keyple components into your project. Just add the following statements to your build.gradle file :

```
repositories {
        //to import releases
        maven { url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases' }
        
        //to import snapshots
        maven {url 'https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
}

dependencies {
     //Keyple core is a mandatory library for using Keyple, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-core
    implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-core', version: '0.8.1'

    //Import Calypso library to support Calypso Portable Object, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-calypso
    implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-calypso', version: '0.8.1'
   
    //Import PCSC library to use a Pcsc reader, in this case import the last version of keyple-java-plugin-pcsc
    implementation group: 'org.eclipse.keyple', name: 'keyple-java-plugin-pcsc', version: '0.8.1'
    ...
}
```
