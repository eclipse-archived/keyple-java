 - [keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7](#keyple-java-plugin-pcsc-07)

 - [keyple-android-plugin-nfc 0.7](#keyple-android-plugin-nfc-07)
 - [keyple-android-plugin-omapi 0.7](#keyple-android-plugin-omapi-07)

### keyple-java-core 0.7
* SE Proxy API: generic universal interface to interface a smartcard reader; transmission of grouped APDU commands; observable reader notification
* Transaction API: management of an explicit application selection on a reader; setting of a default selection operation on an observed reader
* Known issues/limits 
  * Allows the cast of ReaderPlugin & SeReader native classes: could cause a misusage of the API by ticketing application. A ReaderPlugin factory would be necessary for the setting of plugins to the SE Proxy Service.
  * The support for non-ISO Secure Element (memory cards) is limited.
  * Selecting an already selected SE raises a null pointer exception (#73). The re-selection checking has weaknesses (#51). A time-based mechanism should be added to avoid multiple selections.

### keyple-java-calypso 0.7
* Low level API: support of the main Calypso PO & SAM commands
* Transaction API; management a Calypso secure session
* Known issues/limits 
  * the Calypso PO test in contact mode has yet to be performed
  * PO session has to be improved with automatic setting and security counter measures.  
  * Missing the Calypso CLAp automatic setting, the support of the PIN, Stored Value, Confidential session, & Data Signature features.

### keyple-java-plugin-pcsc 0.7
* Interface the Java SmartCardIO API
* Known issues/limits 
  * PcscPlugin has a public visibility.
  * In order to deal with a problem with the implementation of smartcard.io on Windows, we use a hack using reflective code that can induce new problems: compilation on the next Java platforms, strange behavior on other environments (Linux, embedded Linux) See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16921785/smartcard-terminal-removal-scard-e-no-service-cardexception

### keyple-java-plugin-stub 0.7
* Reader plugin emulator: allows to define virtual readers to operate the SE Proxy API without native readers.
* Known issues/limits: 
  * StubPlugin has a public visibility.
  * Some tests have a dependency with the Calypso library.

### keyple-java-plugin-remotese 0.7
* Plugin to communicate remotely with a Secure Element; definition of MasterAPI and SlaveAPI to enable Remote Procedure Call (RPC) between Keyple virtual reader terminals and Keyple native reader terminals. MasterAPI manages virtual reader that acts as a proxy to the remote reader.
* Known limits in 0.7.0 
  * RemoteSePlugin has a public visibility.
  * virtualReader#SePresent() API is not implemented
  * Functions to be renamed in accordance with the RPC standard

### keyple-android-plugin-nfc 0.7
* Plugin interfacing an observable reader operated through the Android NFC API.
* Known issues/limits: 
  * AndroidNfcPlugin has a public visibility.
  * Usage of 'fragment' to remove from the plugin code
  * SE remove detection capability added in Android 7.0 not yet supported.

### keyple-android-plugin-omapi 0.7
* Plugin interfacing static readers operated through the SIM Alliance / GlobalPlatform OMAPI.
* Known issues/limits: 
  * OmapiPlugin has a public visibility.
  * Usage of 'fragment' to remove from the plugin code
  * package API renamed from Android 9.0 not yet supported.
